# Model-Tuning_ReneWind_Project
* "ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors.
* The ReneWind project focuses on using machine learning to predict wind turbine generator failures, aiming to reduce maintenance costs.
* This involves building and tuning various classification models within a pipeline to accurately identify failures, enabling timely repairs. Key aspects include data preparation (including up/downsampling), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
* Skills & Tools Covered
    Up and downsampling
    Regularization
    Hyperparameter tuning
